important notes:

***************zsh globbing*****************

use zsh

chsh to change default shell

echo **/*(*)

echo **/*    -> recursivly show all the files

ls ** -al

echo **/*(rwxAIERWX)

echo **/*(rw)

echo **/*(mM-5)  -> all files modified within last 5 months, [a m c],[Mmwh]

echo **/*(mm+1)

echo **/*(a+1)    ->access a day ago

echo **/*(*m-1)

echo **/*(.m-1)

echo **/*(L+5)   ->file greater than 5 bytes, m for mb, k for kb

diff fromfile1 tofile2   -y --width = 80 mean in the same screen two columns, -b will ignore inline spaces and -B will ignore blank lines

find path command name: 

find . -name "*resume"

find / -perm a=rwx, g=rwx, u=rwx   all,group,user

find . -name "*resume*" -exec echo {} \;

find . -name "*resume*" -exec cp {} \;

locate "*resume*"      need to update db using "sudo updatedb", the search speed will be much faster than find, but cannot search a sepcified dir, the whole system

locate "*resume*" | grep dir    for a sepecific dir.

GDB debug for C files:

Compile using gdb with -g, or using -g3 -gdwarf-2 if you want to include things like preprocessor macros. Probably also use -O0 to turn optimizations off.
